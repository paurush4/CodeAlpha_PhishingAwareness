## Overview
Welcome to the **Phishing Awareness Training**. This module will help you learn how to protect yourself from phishing attacks via email, websites, and social engineering tactics. The training covers the basics of phishing and how to recognize and prevent phishing attempts.

## What is Phishing?
### **Definition**
Phishing is a fraudulent attempt where attackers disguise themselves as trustworthy entities to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and financial details.

### **Goal**
The primary objective of phishing is to steal personal or confidential information.

### **Methods**
Phishing can occur through various channels, including:
- Emails
- Websites
- Phone calls
- Text messages
- Social media

## Key Phishing Statistics
- **3.4 billion phishing emails** are sent daily.
- In **2022, phishing attacks** cost businesses **$1.77 billion**.

## Phishing Techniques
### **Email Phishing**
- **Spoofed Addresses:** Attackers use look-alike domains (e.g., `googgle.com` instead of `google.com`).
- **Urgent Language:** Messages contain threats like "Your account will be suspended!"
- **Grammatical Errors:** Poor English often indicates fraud.
- **Hover Over Links:** Always preview the URL before clicking.

### **Website Phishing**
- **Look-alike URLs:** Domains mimic real websites (e.g., `Paypa1.com` instead of `Paypal.com`).
- **Invalid SSL Certificates:** "Not Secure" warnings may appear.
- **Poor Website Design:** Outdated content, broken images, and unprofessional design.
- **Malicious Pop-Ups:** Fake pop-ups collect personal information.
- **No Privacy Policy:** Lack of terms and privacy policies is a red flag.

## Social Engineering Tactics
1. **Pretexting** – Attackers create a false scenario (e.g., pretending to be IT support).
2. **Baiting** – Victims are lured with incentives (e.g., free gift cards containing malware).
3. **Quid Pro Quo** – Attackers promise services in exchange for information.
4. **Tailgating** – Attackers gain physical access by following authorized personnel.

## Phishing Red Flags
1. **Fake Invoice Email:** Often contains ransomware.
2. **Social Media Message:** Promises free products in exchange for personal details.
3. **IRS Phone Call:** Scammers demand immediate tax payments.
4. **Unusual Sender Address:** Always verify sender details.

## Preventing Phishing Attacks
- **Verify Sender Address:** Contact organizations via official channels.
- **Avoid Clicking Suspicious Links:** Manually type URLs into the browser.
- **Use Strong Passwords:** Implement a password manager and create unique passwords.
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra security layer.
- **Stay Updated:** Keep software and security patches up to date.

## Stay Vigilant, Stay Safe!
1. **Question Everything** – Verify requests before sharing sensitive information.
2. **Report Phishing Attempts** – Notify your IT department or cybersecurity team.
3. **Stay Updated** – Regularly install security updates and patches.

> **Remember:** If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Report any suspicious activity immediately.
