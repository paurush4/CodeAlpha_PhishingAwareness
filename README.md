Phishing Techniques

Email Phishing

Spoofed Addresses: Attackers use look-alike domains (e.g., googgle.com instead of google.com).

Urgent Language: Messages contain threats like "Your account will be suspended!"

Grammatical Errors: Poor English often indicates fraud.

Hover Over Links: Always preview the URL before clicking.

Website Phishing

Look-alike URLs: Domains mimic real websites (e.g., Paypa1.com instead of Paypal.com).

Invalid SSL Certificates: "Not Secure" warnings may appear.

Poor Website Design: Outdated content, broken images, and unprofessional design.

Malicious Pop-Ups: Fake pop-ups collect personal information.

No Privacy Policy: Lack of terms and privacy policies is a red flag.

Social Engineering Tactics

Pretexting – Attackers create a false scenario (e.g., pretending to be IT support).

Baiting – Victims are lured with incentives (e.g., free gift cards containing malware).

Quid Pro Quo – Attackers promise services in exchange for information.

Tailgating – Attackers gain physical access by following authorized personnel.

Phishing Red Flags

Fake Invoice Email: Often contains ransomware.

Social Media Message: Promises free products in exchange for personal details.

IRS Phone Call: Scammers demand immediate tax payments.

Unusual Sender Address: Always verify sender details.

Preventing Phishing Attacks

Verify Sender Address: Contact organizations via official channels.

Avoid Clicking Suspicious Links: Manually type URLs into the browser.

Use Strong Passwords: Implement a password manager and create unique passwords.

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds an extra security layer.

Stay Updated: Keep software and security patches up to date.

Stay Vigilant, Stay Safe!

Question Everything – Verify requests before sharing sensitive information.

Report Phishing Attempts – Notify your IT department or cybersecurity team.

Stay Updated – Regularly install security updates and patches.

Remember: If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Report any suspicious activity immediately.
